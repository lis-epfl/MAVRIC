Calibrating ESC manually

To be able to have good synchronisation between different motors, you need to manually set the max and min for the Throttle.
Otherwise your motors may not have the exact same "zero", which would result in different thrust on each of them.

Before running those steps, you are suppose to :
- have bind your remote and sattelite

Steps:
- unplug motors from the main Board
- connect your sattelite to a normal RC receiver
- plug one motor in the throttle plug of the receiver.
- power-on your remote, put the throttle stick to the top position (full power)
- power on the motors. It will power-on the receiver through the ESC wiring.
- after THIS motor beeps twice, set throttle on the remote down.
- you shall hear 3 beeps (indicating calibration in process)
- test motor putting some throttle and setting back throttle stick down (no turn)
- unplug the battery from the motors.

Then do it for the three others, in the exact same way.

Enjoy your hobby :-)
