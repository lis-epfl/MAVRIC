WARNING:
you will have first to check that you don't create interference with electronic device as much as possible.

go into 
mavlink_actions.c->init_mavlink_actions(void)
Change Mavlink_actions setting of sending IMU RAW and SCALED, from RUN_NEVER to RUN_REGULAR.
Compile and flash the code on the autopilot

Then open QGroundControl
Connect to your quad and go into plot.

As the X, Y and Z value of the magnetometer are in 3D.
level perfectly horizontly the autopilot. If you have already calibrated the IMU, use it to check that you are leveled.

Then,
place the quad pointing north (x <-> north).
oscillate a bit around north and read the Max value of RAW_IMU.xmag.
It will correspond with quad pointing north. write down this value.
Redo the exact same with x pointing south, and write down the min value (south)
Compute the mean_X =(Max-Min)/2
and set Bias_Mag_x = min+mean_X

Do the exact same with y-axis of the quad pointing respectively north and south to get mean_Y.
and set Bias_Mag_y = min+mean_Y

We will not callibrate Bias_MAg_z, as it not used in the code.
You would use the IMU to get the autopilot leveled vertically, and then do the exact same.

Enjoy your hobby :-)
