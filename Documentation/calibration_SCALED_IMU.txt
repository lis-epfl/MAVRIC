Read Calibrating accélerometers PDF file, given in documentation.
It explains how to do what we gonna do.

Resume:
The idea is to get the scaled gain for accelerometer and magnetometer, by turning slowly and gently the board in all direction,
So that accelero and magnetometer get point all around a sphere.
The crucial part, is not to add any forces while turning the board, otherwise the performance of the accelero calibration will dicrease 

Open QGroundControl Software,
Go in Pro->Plot
Be prepare to start turning the board on all direction
Then, Press start logging.

Roll the autopilot to face every orientation.

Press end logging.

Nicolas method:
	Then, we will use Matlab to analyse our results and extract the gain.

	Open Matlab,
	open calibration scripts.m
	Change the file name to point to your logging file
	execute the accelero cellule of that m file.

	you will obtain 3 figures
	- raw accelero
	- an ellipsoide to show the logging point, so that you can check that you get log all around the sphere.
	- scaled acceleromter (between 1 and -1)

	Read in Matlab console the output scaled factor for the accelerometer.
	You will have to paste them in Code/Your_Project/src/config/conf_imu_rev4.h file

	Then repeat the same to get the scaled gain of the magnetometer !!!

	Good luck and enjoy your hobby :-)
Julien method
	For using python scripts by julien, on windows
	install python 2.7
	install PyQt4 same distribution (eg x64)
