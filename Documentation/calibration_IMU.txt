To calibrate the IMU:

go into 
mavlink_actions.c->init_mavlink_actions(void)
Change Mavlink_actions setting of sending IMU RAW and SCALED, from RUN_NEVER to RUN_REGULAR.
Compile and flash the code on the autopilot

Then open QGroundControl
Connect to your quad and go into plot.

Level your quad on a nice surface !!!
YOUR GOAL:
For SCALED IMU X and Y you should have their mean value at zero.
For SCALED IMU Z you get its mean value at 1000 (=1 gravity unit * 1000)

Therefore:
Change in CONFIG, the bias of the IMU to fit those mean values.
=> set Bias_Acc_X as current mean of RAW_IMU.xacc, 
=> set Bias_Acc_Y as current mean of RAW_IMU.yacc.
=> set Bias_Acc_Z manually to reach the SCALED_IMU.zacc mean of 1000.

Then press: Write(ROM), and check on the debug port, if opened, that the write to flash had succeed.

Check in QGroundControl->Flight that the IMU is leveled correctly.

Then go back to atmel and set back mavlink actions to RUN_NEVER.

Enjoy your hobby :-)
