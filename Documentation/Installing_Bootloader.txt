Installing the DFU bootloader on AVR32 devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This document describes the necessary steps to flash a DFU bootloader onto the AVR32 (AT32UC3C1512C) used on the maveric autopilot. Note that all Atmel devices with USB support have the DFU bootloader already installed by default, however, a chip erase carried out with the JTAG will erase the bootloader, and it needs to be re-flashed if needed. To avoid removing the bootloader when using JTAG in Atmel Studio, go to Project Settings -> Tool, and change "Programming Settings" to "Erase only program area". 

#######################################
1) Flashing the bootloader image
#######################################

- Open Atmel Studio, go to Tools -> Device Programming. 
   - connect your board to the JTAG cable, and check if it has power
   - select JTAGICE3 tool (should be listed if connected properly), Device AT32UC3C1512C, Interface JTAG, and click Apply. 
   - to verify if the board is powered, click "Target Voltage". It should be above 3.0 V and not give and error. 
   - to verify if the chip is responding, click "Device signature". If any of the above steps fail, check all cables and connections and repeat.

- Go to Tab "Memories"
   - optional: Do a full chip erase
   - under "Flash", select the bootloader image file <...>/maveric/Code/Library/Bootloader/BOOTLOADER_AT32UC3C1512.hex
   - Program the flash
   - under "Userpage", select the bootloader userpage file <...>/maveric/Code/Library/Bootloader/USERPAGE_BOOT_SDA1.hex
   - Program the user page
- Go to Tab "Fuses"
   - verify that "Auto Read" is enabled, or "Read" fuses from the AVR
   - for BOOTPROT, select BOOTAREA_8KB
   - Click "Program" again


To flash the chip via the bootloader, one needs dfu-programmer (in Linux and windows). To find informations about DFU-programmer, read the related documentation.
