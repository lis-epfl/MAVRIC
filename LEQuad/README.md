LEQuad is the default project for MAVRIC framework.

You can use it directly, or clone it for making a new project, in the term of our License (cf files' header)

On **windows**, you need to create a symbolique link called Library pointing to ..\MAVRIC_Library folder
(run a console in LEQuad folder and do `mklink /D Library ..\MAVRIC_Library`)
