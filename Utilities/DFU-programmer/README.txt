The DFU folder, contains the unzipped file contained in dfu-programmer-win-0.6.2.zip, which are the pre-compiled Windows executable, the USB drivers for use with Atmel chips in DFU bootloader mode and dfu-programming.bat.
The Windows executable does not need any installation or setup.
The Windows driver can be installed when prompted by Windows when a DFU device is attached. Do not let Windows search for a driver; specify the path to search for a driver and point it to the .inf file.
The dfu-programming.bat script has to be copied once in your project directory. This script is pointing in DFU folder to flash your last compiled .hex to your maveric board through DFU. This file must be placed in your project directory root (ex. Maveric_myCopter) and will flash (if not modified) the file Release/megafly.hex.
